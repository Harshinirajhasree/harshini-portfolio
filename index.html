  <p>
    The Community Connect Internship is an experiential learning program designed
    to expose students to real-world social environments and the functioning of
    non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This internship emphasized social
    responsibility, empathy, and the application of theoretical knowledge in
    community-based settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    I completed my one-month internship (June 10 – July 10, 2025) at Shree Dhevi
    Charitable Trust, Walajapet, Ranipet District, under the guidance of
    Dr. Purushothaman, a well-known social worker and healthcare professional.
    The organization supports underprivileged communities through initiatives
    in education, healthcare, environmental awareness, and empowerment.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the internship, I participated in awareness programs, food and
    clothing distribution, environmental initiatives, and child welfare
    engagement activities. This experience enhanced my understanding of how
    NGOs contribute to social development and strengthened my sense of social
    responsibility and community engagement.
